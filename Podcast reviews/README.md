# Podcast Reviews

[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews) from Kaggle, that contains information about Apple Podcasts, most notably their reviews and associated ratings.

Interesting insights:
- A large number of reviews were written in 2019. 50 % of all reviews were written between 2017 and 2020.
- Most reviews come with a positive 5 star rating.
- TOP 3 podcast categories - business, religion-spirituality and education.

From Word clouds:
- Generally, positive reviews include positive adjectives, nouns, such as "true crime", "family", "girl", "man", "kid" and also words that might indicate what aspects listeners were enjoying in the podcasts - "interview", "discussion".
- Negative reviews often include words "host" and "guy", which is probably one the most common reasons why people gave podcasts negative reviews.
