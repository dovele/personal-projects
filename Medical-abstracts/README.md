# Biomedical abstracts
This projects demonstrates how you can extract biomedical article information (abstracts) for a specific search term using E-Utils API and further use it for analysis.

The goal is to **automate literature analysis** when doing research work. My topic of choice for this analysis is "neuroplasticity". It's quite a broad topic, so i'm interested what other topics might be related to neuroplasticity research.

This analysis may be useful if i'm interested in most common topics. It could give a more definitive answer to questions about what type of research is currently in vogue in my area of interest.
