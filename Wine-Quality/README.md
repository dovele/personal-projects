# Wine quality analysis
This projects is about portuquese Vinho Verde wine.
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical and sensory ('quality') variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

Features:
* Alcohol: the amount of alcohol in wine
* Volatile acidity: acetic acid content which leading to an unpleasant vinegar taste
* Sulphates: a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
* Citric Acid: acts as a preservative to increase acidity (small quantities add freshness and flavor to wines)
* Total Sulfur Dioxide: is the amount of SO2
* Density: sweeter wines have a higher density
* Chlorides: the amount of salt
* Fixed acidity: are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate easily
* pH: the level of acidity
* Free Sulfur Dioxide: it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
* Residual sugar: is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. (Wines > 45g/ltrs are sweet)

Target variable - quality (scale from 1 to 10).
